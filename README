You are trapped in the CAVEZ of PHEAR, your mission is to escape
through all the caves and make it out alive. To escape through a
cave you will have to find all the diamonds located in it. Once
you've found all the diamonds, their powers combined will help you
get to the next cave, one step closer to freedom.

By picking up a diamond (*) you get 10 points, picking up money ($)
gives you 100 points. You get one extra life for every 1000 points
you score.

Move around with the arrow keys or the 2-4-8-6 keys. Press 'k' to 
commit suicide if you should get stuck.

Got the bombs (%)? Great! Press 'b' to place them, and 't' to detonate
them all at once. Note that the bombs you place will act just like
stones, affected by gravity, rolling, and so on..

Watch out for monsters (M) -- if they catch you, you will die. To
fight back, drop stones on them or blow them up using your bombs.

Pressing 's' will enable/disable sound, 'w' will highlight your
current position.
